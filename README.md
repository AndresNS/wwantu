# Why?
We are looking for a new members for our team. So, in order to know you a little bit we have created a challenge.

# The Challenge
We are looking to a way that allows us to fetch our favorites songs from Spotify, store, and filter inside our own app. Why? Why not!

## Brief
- The app must have a basic form with a "search field" and a button "search"
- When a user completes the movie name (or part of it) in the field "search field" an press the button "search". The app must connect to http://www.omdbapi.com/, fetch and display the results.
- (++) Every result must have a button to save the result as favourite in the database app

> (++) Bonus track 👏
